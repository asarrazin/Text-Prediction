The ocean is a magical place that is full of beautiful creatures. There are sharks that swim in the ocean and eat small fish. Sharks can be scary. Dolphins are mammals that swim in the ocean, but breathe air instead of using their gills to breathe water. Coral is a creature that stays still under the water. Coral does not move very much. There are many different species of sharks which swim underneath the waves. If you want to swim in the ocean, you must be careful of sharks. Sharks can take a bite of you if you are not careful while you swim. If you use a submarine, you can dive underneath the surface of the ocean and see many creatures. A submarine swims at deep levels of the ocean. 


When I go to the park, I like to walk around the paths. There is grass around the park and in between the paths of the park. At the park, there are dogs running around and there are squirrels that eat nuts in the trees. If I want fresh air and exercise, I run on the paths in the park. Running is a fun activity if you to get a workout. 

A park is an area of natural, natural or planted space set aside for human enjoyment and recreation or for the protection of wildlife or natural habitats. Urban parks are green spaces set aside for recreation inside towns and cities. National parks and Country parks are green spaces used for recreation in the countryside. State parks and Provincial parks are administered by sub-national government states and agencies. Parks may consist of grassy areas, rocks, soil and trees, but may also contain buildings and other artifacts such as monuments, fountains or playground structures. Many parks have fields for playing sports such as soccer, baseball and football, and paved areas for games such as basketball. Many parks have trails for walking, biking and other activities. Some parks are built adjacent to bodies of water or watercourses and may comprise a beach or boat dock area. Urban parks often have benches for sitting and may contain picnic tables and barbecue grills.

The largest parks can be vast natural areas of hundreds of thousands square kilometers or square miles, with abundant wildlife and natural features such as mountains and rivers. In many large parks, camping in tents is allowed with a permit. Many natural parks are protected by law, and users may have to follow restrictions rules against open fires or bringing in glass bottles. Large national and sub-national parks are typically overseen by a park ranger or a park warden. Large parks may have areas for canoeing and hiking in the warmer months and, in some northern hemisphere countries, cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in colder months. There are also amusement parks which have live shows, fairground rides, refreshments, and games of chance or skill.


Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, is the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms produce oxygen. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land.

Most life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans provide about percent of the living space on the planet. The earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish, which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into amphibians which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as seals, dolphins or whales. Plant forms such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton, and particularly phytoplankton, are key primary producers forming the general foundation of the ocean food chain.

Marine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes see insect and mollusk siphons and gills. Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air.
