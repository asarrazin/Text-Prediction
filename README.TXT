PROJECT TITLE: Predictive Keyboard 
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The human brain requires a preexisting knowledge of language in order to process and produce everyday communication. Although many have attempted to artificially replicate the way in which human brains store this information, only few have been able to model the human cognitive architecture. We sought to create a simple, but effective, predictive word generator by using variations of the same insightful principles that the human brain uses to make predictions, employing word association models, grammar rules, and sentence topic detection. We incorporated context analysis and word association as well as basic language principles to produce word predictions that are more accurate and helpful than those produced by simple statistical mechanisms.
